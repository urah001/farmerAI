The `aim` of this study is to develop an AI-driven web application for farming support to help
farmers make data-driven decisions, increase productivity, and promote sustainable agriculture.

The system will provide real-time insights on crop management, pest control, and irrigation,
offering automated recommendations to optimize farming practices.
The objectives of the study are to:

i. Collate and preprocess data on soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health from
online and locally available data sources.

ii. Train machine learning algorithms to forecast precise farming decisions.

iii. To develop a high performing model with an intuitive online platform that guarantees
accessible for farmers with different degrees of technical expertise.

iv. To evaluate the performance metrics like accuracy, F1, score and recall.


> for the limitation : 
 - disease-detection :  would need a larger library/database for learning which would help the machine learning model identify new diseases 
 


# remember
> Attributes or features, in machine learning can be considered as data fields that represent properties of a data object - for example, a customer's ID, address, etc. These combined attributes describing a specific object are also known as attribute vectors or machine learning feature vectors.

# features
> image animation ( little )

> on user active in specific page ( show true if a user is in this page)

> try and get the model built accuracy and screenshot

> add the about page , write about the system 

> subsection : about the algorithm used
